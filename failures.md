# Failure Modes & Error Handling

Issues encountered so far; solutions & procedures pending:

---

!> **Problem:** OGN Raspberry Pi computer crashes; startup sequence failure, (i.e. canâ€™t SSH in!)
> **Solution:** Manually power cycle the PoE port that the Pi is connected to, via the SunMAX SolarPoint web interface, otherwise; visit the mountain-top relay station, inspect and repair.

---

!> **Problem:** SunMAX SolarPoint solar charge controller failure.
> **Solution:** If the station is entirely offline, visit the mountain-top relay station; inspect and repair.

---

!> **Problem:** Power bus over- or under-voltage.
> **Solution:** Remotely log into MPPT charge controller; inspect logs. Compare with temperature sensor data from brain/box Raspberry Pi database.

---

!> **Problem:** Battery, charge controller, or brain/box internal over-temperature.
> **Solution:** Preempt with white brain/box covering, burying underneath larger thermal mass on-site. If still over-temp, 

---

!> **Problem:** Mast component over-temperature.
> **Solution:** Shutdown of the mast Raspberry Pi and SDR module for a few hours; i.e. disabling OGN to preserve the life of the components. If necessary, visit the mountain-top relay station; inspect and replace Pi if failed.

---

!> **Problem:** Battery failure.
> **Solution:** Visit the mountain-top relay station; inspect and repair.

--- 

!> **Problem:** PowerBeam (long-range wifi radio link) failure.
> **Solution:** Visit the mountain-top relay station; inspect and repair.

---

!> **Problem:** LAN relay failure.
> **Solution:** Visit the mountain-top relay station; inspect and repair.

---

!> **Problem:** Fire.
> **Solution:** Call 9-1-1 and report the fire, possibly electrical. Visit the mountain-top relay station; inspect and repair.

---

!> **Problem:** Physical damage, i.e. electrical or electrostatic discharge, data or power cabling, mast or support structure failure, animal disturbances or damage.
> **Solution:** Visit the mountain-top relay station; inspect and repair.

---

!> **Problem:** Theft / vandalism.
> **Solution:** Deploy vandal-resistant key locks on brain/box; cut-resistant physical security guy wire anchored to rock pinion.

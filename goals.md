# Project Goals
- Increase regional pilot and aircraft safety.
- Improve situational awareness of our club aircraft..
- Create visibility of our club aircraft to on-site and off-site VSA club members and the public.

### Separation of Concerns
- Receiving and decoding FLARM radio data.
- Retransmitting FLARM radio data to OGN.
- Updating and maintaining RTL/OGN relay daemon.
- Updating and maintaining the Raspberry Pi that the relay daemon runs on.
- Broadband IP communications link between VSA clubouse network and off-grid relay station on a nearby (~3.5km) mountain-top.
- Power management;
  - Battery charge status.
  - Battery health status.
  - Battery temperature status.
  - Solar charge status.
  - Electrical load status.
  - Relay station subsystems power status'.
- Relay station subsystem cycling/reboot control.
- Relay station subsystem logging and nightly data offload.

### Future "Nice to Have" Features
- Weather station; mast-mounted temperature, barometer, wind vane/impeller, humidity, precipitation, etc.
- IP camera (ie. viewing visual weather conditions from mountain-top) for VSA club members only.
- IP camera (physical security / wildlife intrusion) relay station visual monitoring, for VSA club members only.

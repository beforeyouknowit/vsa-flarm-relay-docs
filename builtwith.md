# This project was built with these tools and frameworks:

- [Open Glider Network](https://www.glidernet.org/) for real-time  glider, paraglider, UAV tracking and visibility on the web.
- Check the [OGN Wiki](http://wiki.glidernet.org/start) for technical documentation, and explore the [OGN-RF](https://github.com/glidernet/ogn-rf) code repository.
- [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/iot/raspberry-pi-2-3) and [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
- Ubiquiti Networks [PowerBeam AC Gen2](https://www.ui.com/airmax/powerbeam-ac-gen2/) long-range wifi radios.
- [Github](https://www.github.com/) for hosting our [project documentation](https://github.com/beforeyouknowit/vsa-flarm-relay-docs) and development collaboration.
- [Docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/) for building and maintaining this project's documentation website; documentation written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
